Aims and Objectives

This research aims to develop an advanced SHM framework by integrating DT technology with hybrid deep learning architectures to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of structural damage detection and classification. The study begins by creating high-fidelity DT models of bridge structures through finite element simulations, generating synthetic vibration datasets that account for diverse operational conditions and damage scenarios. Building on this foundation, hybrid deep learning models—1D CNNs with LSTM and 1D CNNs with Transformer—are designed to capture spatial-temporal features and long-range dependencies in vibration signals. To refine these models, Bayesian optimization via the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) is employed to mitigate overfitting, improve generalizability, and identify the most valuable sensor nodes for targeted data training. By focusing on these critical nodes, the framework enables more efficient and rapid damage diagnosis. The efficacy of the proposed approach is rigorously validated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Through a comparative analysis of the CNN-LSTM and CNN-Transformer models, the study demonstrates the CNN-LSTM’s superiority in long-sequence analysis while establishing a scalable, resource-efficient workflow. This work contributes a novel integration of DT simulations with deep learning for automated, real-time SHM, ultimately advancing infrastructure resilience against deterioration and catastrophic failures.
